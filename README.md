## c_create
I found it slightly annoying to type in the boilerplate code for C programs along
with its makefile everytime I created a new C project.

And so, I'm creating a python program which will set up and initialize a C
programming project for you, so that you spend less time setting everything up,
and more time on your actual code.

This project is still under development.
